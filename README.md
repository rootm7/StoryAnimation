# StoryAnimation
CSC 124 Building Better Apps Project
This game was completed as an assignment for CSC 124 at Berea College.

This app is a tap animation that tells the story of a personal experience from my life.

The user taps the screen rapidly to see the animation. This animation will repeat over and over for as long as the user taps the screen. Each animation is between 3-5 frames in length.
